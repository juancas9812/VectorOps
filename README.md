# VectorOps

This repository contains the exercises on vector type operations for Plan Semilla Equinox.

The idea from the [Vector_Cats.ipynb](Vector_Cats.ipynb) is at first to determine the frames of a video where the pipe is shown the most, and also apply different transformations in the video using vectorized operations (the example made is to add random lines with random colors)
